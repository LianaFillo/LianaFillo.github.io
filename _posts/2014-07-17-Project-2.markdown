description: Using the DartFish platform, I was able to learn what high performance athletes and coaches are doing to analyze movements in sport and improve performance. We were able to play around using different clips in order to analyze movements. This is a clip that I created where I compared a clinet's "poor form" squat vs. a "good form" squat using DartFish. <a href = https://dartfi.sh/Zyv5KfIVj4j"> Click here to view my video in full </a> <img src="img/portfolio/video1.png" alt="Video1" width="100%"> This is what the webpage will look once you are viewing. The left view is the good squat while the right view is the poor squat. <img src="img/portfolio/video2.png" alt="Video2" width="100%"> Using the angles tool, I was able to numerically and visually quantify the poor posture of the clients back while doing a squat.<img src="img/portfolio/video3.png" alt="Video3" width="100%"> The ability to create still shots allows for the coach and athletes to pause their movements and break them down into different parts. The arrow helps the client see how she is moving her body in relation to the ground. <img src="img/portfolio/video4.png" alt="Video1" width="100%"> Once again, the angles allow for visual and numerical perspectives on proper form when doing an exercise. <img src="img/portfolio/video5.png" alt="video5" width="100%"> Finally, even the ending position of the client shows the upper body differences when completing a proper vs bad squat.
